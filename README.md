# Hippocampus_LLM_MemoryMap
The project aims to enhance LLMs with structured, persistent memory capabilities inspired by the hippocampal-entorhinal memory system in the human brain. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on expanded context windows or simple vector retrieval, our approach represents memories in a cognitive map that encodes rich relationships
